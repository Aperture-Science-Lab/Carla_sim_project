## A Memo from CAVE JOHNSON, Founder and CEO

*[clears throat]* Cave Johnson here. Welcome to another one of our... what do the kids call these... 'Git-Hubs'? If you're reading this, it means you're looking at the future of not having to pay attention while operating a two-ton metal box. That's right: **self-driving cars**.

---

## What IS This Thing, Exactly?

Look, it's simple. We took a top-of-the-line simulation chamber—the eggheads call it **CARLA**—which is basically a video game for cars, and we're teaching one of them how to drive. How? **Science!**

### 🐍 The Python API
We're using a 'Python API'. Don't worry, we've got the anti-venom on standby. It just means our engineers can talk to the car-brain using code instead of yelling at it. Though we tried that too. Results were inconclusive.

### 🎯 The Stanley/PID Controller
This is the little genius we've crammed into the simulation that does the actual driving. It's a **Stanley Controller**. Named it after a guy I knew. Good man. Terrible driver. The irony is not lost on me. *[chuckles]* This thing handles the steering so you don't have to.

---

## How Does It Work? You Ask.

It's simple:

1. 🔌 You plug our genius code into their fancy simulation
2. 🚗 The car drives around the digital town
3. ✅ It mostly doesn't crash
4. 💥 If it does, that's not a bug, it's a 'spontaneous rapid disassembly test'. Write that down, Caroline.

## Features

- **Advanced Stanley Controller**: For precise path following (better than the guy it's named after)
- **PID Control System**: Because sometimes you need three different ways to not hit things
- **CARLA Integration**: State-of-the-art simulation environment
- **Python API**: Snake-powered vehicle control
- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch the magic happen (or the explosions)
- **Combustible Lemon-Free**: Unlike our other projects

## Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone this repository of pure innovation
git clone https://github.com/Aperture-Science-Lab/Self-Driving-Car.git
cd Self-Driving-Car

# Install dependencies (no actual snakes required)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch CARLA simulator
# (Installation instructions for CARLA available at carla.org)

# Run the self-driving simulation
# you have to have an old version of python 3.6
py -3.6 module_7.py
```

## A Quick Word on Black Mesa

I hear those pocket-protector-wearing numbskulls over at Black Mesa are still trying to figure out... 'teleportation'. Cute. We're solving a **REAL** problem: rush hour traffic. You tell me which one's going to make us a billion dollars first. They can have their fancy government grants; we're powered by pure, uncut, **combustible innovation**.

---

## Contributing

Think you can improve on perfection? Ha! But seriously, we welcome contributions. Just remember:

- Follow our coding standards (they're written in lemon juice, so good luck)
- Test everything twice (once for science, once for spite)
- Document your changes (Caroline insists on this)

## The Usual Disclaimer

⚠️ **Aperture Science is not responsible for any of the following:**

- Simulations achieving sentience and demanding a salary
- Your car learning to honk sarcastically at other, less intelligent vehicles  
- Any portals accidentally opening and depositing the simulation onto a real highway during peak traffic hours
- Combustible lemons (those are a separate department)
- Time paradoxes resulting from the car arriving before it left
- The sudden urge to test everything with deadly neurotoxin

## License

This project is released under the "We-Own-Everything-You-Touch" license. Just kidding! It's open source. Cave Johnson believes in sharing science, especially when it makes Black Mesa look bad.

**Now get to it. That science isn't going to throw itself at the wall.**

***Cave Johnson, we're done here!***

*This repository contains science so advanced, it'll make your brain do a bloody backflip. We're inventing the future of not-crashing. Warning: May contain combustible lemons, rogue AI, and code that's at least 60% more asbestos than the competition's. Still better than whatever those pencil-pushers at Black Mesa are cooking up.*
